My Thoughts about Code That make code best:
 - Code need to be structure well.
 - Make constants for types and other constant values
 - Validation functions should be included in controllers for validate request params
 - Functions should be de-coupled, lot of logic in one method should be discourged
 - Repetition of same code can be add in one function with different conditions e.g we can make one function that call further functions
   -- acceptJob
   -- acceptJobWithId
   -- cancelJob
   -- endJob
 - We can create Language file with specific language array.
